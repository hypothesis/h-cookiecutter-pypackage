Hypothesis Python Module Cookiecutter Template
==============================================

A template for creating Python modules

Features
--------

 * Provides all of the boilerplate config required for:
   * Linting
   * Formatting
   * Testing
   * Building packages locally 
   * Building packages in gitlab
 * This also provides the ability to replay the template at any time
 * Leaves you to worry about your code

Generating a new project
------------------------

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter git@github.com:hypothesis/h-cookiecutter-pypackage.git
```

After that you will be asked some questions. For "options" just go with the default.

Replaying the template
----------------------

In a project generated by this template you can run the following:

    make template

This will read the `.cookiecutter.json` file in your directory and replay the
templated files, overwriting local changes.

If you would like a particular file to be preserved you can add it
to: `"options.disable_replay"` in the `.cookiecutter.json` file. You can also
just not commit the changes made if you don't like them.
